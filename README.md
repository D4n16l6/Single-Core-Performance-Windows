# Single-Core-Performance-Windows
A test for single core sequential computing speed on Windows.

On an intuition of my dear friend and colleague ing. Alberto Sozzi we have performed several tests on different machines with Intel and AMD CPUs in order to be able to evaluate the performance related to pure sequential calculation for single core of modern CPUs. I proposed to Eng. You dare to publish the results and the code used so that both can be subject to further consideration and verification by the community.
The tests were conducted by Eng. Sozzi, by myself and our other dear friend Franco.
